# Speech Enhancement using GAN â€” Experiments

This repository contains my experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement.  
It has been developed and further modified based on publicly available open-source work.

## Features / Contributions
- Training and validation setup for GAN-based speech enhancement.
- Experimented with different hyperparameters and training settings.
- Added evaluation metrics and plots.
- Organized notebook for easier understanding and reproducibility.
