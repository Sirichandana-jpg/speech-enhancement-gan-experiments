# 🎤 Speech Enhancement GAN 

A GAN-based approach for enhancing speech from noisy audio.

---

## 🔹 About
This project is a *GAN-based model for speech enhancement*, trained to remove noise from audio signals.  

It is based on an earlier implementation, with *modifications and improvements*, including:
- ✅ Updated training pipeline  
- ✅ Cleaned dataset handling  
- ✅ Additional documentation  
- ✅ Dual licensing for clarity
 ## 🔹 Overview

This project implements a speech enhancement system using CNN-GAN, which takes noisy audio as input and outputs cleaner, enhanced speech. The GAN architecture helps the model generate realistic, high-quality audio while reducing noise.

Key Features:
1.Noise reduction from audio recordings
2.CNN-based generator for feature extraction
3.GAN discriminator for realistic audio reconstruction
4.Compatible with Python 3.x and PyTorch/TensorFlow
## 🚀 Getting Started

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Sirichandana-jpg>/<speech-enhancement-gan-experiments>.git
cd <speech-enhancement-gan-experiments>

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Typical dependencies:
-torch / tensorflow
-numpy
-librosa
-soundfile
-matplotlib (for visualizations)

### 3️⃣ Train the Model
```bash
python train.py --dataset data/noisy --clean data/clean

### 4️⃣ Test the Model
```bash
python test.py --input data/test_noisy

🔹 Dataset
-Use your own clean and noisy audio datasets:
-train/noisy/ - Noisy training audio
-train/clean/ - Clean training audio
-test/noisy/ - Noisy testing audio
-test/clean/ - Clean testing audio
-You can prepare datasets like VoiceBank + DEMAND or your custom recordings.
